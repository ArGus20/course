<h2>George Orwell - 1984</h2>

<h3><span>Chapter One</span> Thoughtcrime</h3>
    
<p><i>
    &nbsp;It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen. <span>Winston Smith</span> hurried home to Victory Mansions with his head down to escape the terrible wind. A cloud of dust blew inside with him, and the hall smelled of dust and yesterday's food.
</i></p>

<p><i>
    &nbsp;At the end of the hall, a poster covered one wall. It showed an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a handsome man of about forty-five, with a large, black moustache. The man's eyes seemed to follow Winston as he moved. Below the face were the words <span>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU</span>.
</i></p>

<h3><span>Chapter Two</span> The Spies</h3>

<p><i>
    &nbsp;As he opened the door, <span>Winston</span> saw that he had left the diary open on the table. <span>WITH BIG BROTHER</span> was written in it, in letters you could almost read across the room. But everything was all right. A small, sad-looking woman was standing outside.
