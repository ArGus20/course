            <h3>Metallica</h3>

            <p>
                &nbsp;Metallica is an American heavy metal band. The band was       formed    in 1981 in Los Angeles by vocalist and guitarist James    Hetfield and    drummer Lars Ulrich, and has been based in San    Francisco for most of   its career. The band's fast tempos,      instrumentals and aggressive  musicianship made them one of the    founding "big four" bands of   thrash metal, alongside Megadeth,     Anthrax and Slayer.

                &nbsp;Metallica first found commercial success with the release         of  its third album, Master of Puppets (1986), cited as one of      the   heaviest metal albums and the band's best work. The band's        next   album, ...And Justice for All (1988), gave Metallica its        first    Grammy Award nomination. Metallica has released ten       studio albums,     four live albums, twelve video albums, a        cover album, two extended  plays, 37 singles and 39 music videos.
