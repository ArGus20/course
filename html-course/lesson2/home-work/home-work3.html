<h4>George Orwell - 1984</h4>

<hr>

<p><i>
    &nbsp;It was a bright, cold day in April and the clocks were striking thirteen. Winston Smith hurried home to Victory Mansions with his head down to escape the terrible wind. A cloud of dust blew inside with him, and the hall smelled of dust and yesterday's food.
</i></p>

<p><i>
    &nbsp;At the end of the hall, a poster covered one wall. It showed an enormous face, more than a metre wide: the face of a handsome man of about forty-five, with a large, black moustache. The man's eyes seemed to follow Winston as he moved. Below the face were the words <b>BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU</b>.
